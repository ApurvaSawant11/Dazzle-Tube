    title: "How I make ceramics at my home studio (hand-built ceramics) | The entire pottery process",
    description:
      "Today I thought I would show you all my process of creating ceramics in my home 'studio'. This is not a tutorial, it is just to show you guys a little glimpse into my own ceramic process. I create my ceramics using the ancient form of coiling and pinch pots, so no pottery wheel is used. I love the slow pace and mindfulness that hand-building ceramics requires. Hand-built pieces also have an organic and rustic feel that I adore. Anyways I hope you enjoyed this video!",
